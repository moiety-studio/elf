# About

Elf was created to help me start new 11ty projects with ease.

## Accessibility

Elf was built with accessibility in mind. It uses semantic HTML, has contrasting colours, and applies progressive enhancements.

## Performance

- CSS is minimised (with the help of [postcss-minify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-minify))

## Security

- AI scraping is hindered via `robots.txt` and  a `.htaccess` file.

## Development standards

- [SemVer](https://semver.org) is used for versioning
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) us used for commit messages
- New features are developed in branches
- Merges happen via squash merge
