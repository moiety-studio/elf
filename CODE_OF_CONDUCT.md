# Code of Conduct

People are awesome. People are awesome in different ways. We would like people to be awesome in their own way while working with us. Our goal is to provide an atmosphere where all of us can get along.

To get into more specifics, this means we do not tolerate any harassment or disrespect of our employees or customers due to age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

This Code of Conduct covers all activities related to Elf.
